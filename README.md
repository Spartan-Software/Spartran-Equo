# Equo - TheNewWayToSave
Need to store something that you need super securly? Super fast? Super reliable? Well you found just the thing!

Lets say you need to store passwords.

With Equo you can simply save it by entering NameOfPassword = "password" | Make sure to use "" NOT ''. When you need to retrive it, just type the password name. We reccomend settings it up like this so it is easy to remember: gmailSchool = "passwordeg1234"

# What is coming up in V2.

In 2.0, we will introduce MORE COMMANDS! for Equo.
Also, everything will get saved in version2. 
Till then, remember to keep the app open!

# Modules needed for now

Until 2.0, you need to have: Python3 and Sly installed.

# Examples

```
# To store:
x11$ SchMail = "PasswordOfSchoolMail"
# To retrive:
x11$ SchMail
# Simple Calcs:
x11$ 23+23
#Output:
x11$ 46
```
